Contact Form with Google Invisible ReCaptcha

This is an example of how to implement a form using Google Invisible Recaptcha through PHP Mailer and AJAX.

To start,

1) Obtain both your public and secret keys on the ReCaptcha website with your Google account.

2) Place them in the process file and in the datasitekey attribute on the button tag at the bottom of the form.

3) Replace the Mail settings in process.php with your SMTP settings (email account, password, server which you would like to send from as well as from email/name and finally what email you would like emails to send to).

4) Should work fine.
